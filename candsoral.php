       <div class="title1"> 1. Tooth Decay </div>
    <div class="oral">
    Tooth decay is also known as dental caries or dental cavities. It is the most common dental problem that dentists see in patients. Practically everyone, at some point in their life, has experienced tooth decay. 
    
    <p> <div class="title11">
    Tooth decay occurs when bacteria form a film, called plaque, on the surface of teeth. The bacteria produce acids from the sugars in food. The acids eat away at and permanently damage the enamel, or outer layer, of the tooth. The acids then start working on the softer dentin layer beneath the enamel. 
    </div></p>    
    
    <p>
        
     This breakdown of the tooth can lead to cavities or holes in your teeth. It can also cause toothaches, including pain when you eat and drink hot, cold, or sweet things.    
    </p>
     
    <p>
        
        Other symptoms of tooth decay may include:<br>

     Bad breath<br>
     Black or brown spots on your teeth<br><!-- comment -->
     An unpleasant taste in your mouth <br>
    </p>
     
    <p>
     Dental care begins with assessing the extent of your tooth decay and recommending a course of action. This may include fillings, crowns, or a root canal. The option chosen may be extraction followed by dental implants or dentures.   
        
    </p>
     
    <p>
         
     You can help to prevent tooth decay with regular (twice daily) brushing and flossing. Also, get regular checkups from your dentist to have the plaque scraped from your teeth.   
    </p>
     
    <div class="title2"> 2. Gum Disease </div>
    <div>
        
          
    Gingivitis is the early stage and mild form of gum or periodontal disease. It is a bacterial infection that is caused by the buildup of plaque. Common symptoms are gums that are red, swollen, and bleed easily. You may also experience bad breath and sensitive teeth that hurt when you chew
    
    <p> 
    Skipping brushing and poor brushing techniques can contribute to gum disease. So, too, can crooked teeth that are hard to brush properly. Other risk factors include tobacco use, pregnancy, and diabetes.
    </p>    
    
    <p>
        
     It is important to note that gingivitis can be painless and as such, you may not notice it. This makes regular dental checkups a good idea
    </p>
     
    <p>
        
       Gingivitis can be treated by a thorough cleaning from your dental health professional. To prevent it from coming back, you will have to practice twice-daily brushing and flossing

    </p>
     
    <p>
        Periodontitis<br>
Left untreated, gingivitis can become a more severe form of gum disease called periodontitis. This is when pockets in the gum become infected. This can lead to damage of the bone and tissue that hold the teeth, as these, too, become infected
        
    </p>
     
    <p>
         
        It can also lead to <br><!-- comment -->
    <div class="shoots">
       ⚫ Shrinking and receding gums<br><!-- comment -->
       ⚫ Loose permanent teeth<br>
       ⚫ A change in bite<br>
       ⚫ An unpleasant taste in your mouth<br>
       ⚫ Persistent bad breath<br>
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        
        What's more, periodontitis can trigger an inflammatory response throughout your body.
    </p>
    <p>
        
        Dental care for periodontitis includes topical antibiotics to treat the infection or a referral to a periodontist – a gum disease specialist.

        <div class="title2"> 3. Bad Breath</div>
    <div>
        
        
    Bad breath or halitosis is one of the most common dental problems. It is also among the most distressing. Bad breath can be caused by several different factors, including:
    
     
     Poor oral hygiene
     <div>
        <ol>
            <li>⚫ Dry mouth</li><br><!-- comment -->
            <li>⚫ Medication</li><br>
            <li>⚫ Infection</li><br>     
            <li>⚫ Acid reflux</li><br>
            <li>⚫ Cancer</li><br>  
        </ol>
     </div>
   
    
    <p>
        
     One or more of the foods you eat could also be the cause of your halitosis. Spices such as garlic and onion are common culprits.
    </p>
     
    <p>
        
       Because the causes of bad breath are so varied, your dentist will do a complete assessment and prescribe a course of action that best suits your case.
